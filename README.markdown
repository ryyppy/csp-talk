# CSP in JavaScript: Why Generators Are Awesome 

This was a talk about `Communicating Sequential Processes` I initially held at ReactJS ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland on the 21st of
November 2016.

There came some questions up, which I could not answer right away, so I wanted
to put in some references, which will probably answer those questions:

## How to run this interactive presentation?

This is a Spectacle project, so you will need Node.js installed to run it ;-)

**Clone the repository and run following commands:**

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then you can access the presentation on `http://localhost:3000`
